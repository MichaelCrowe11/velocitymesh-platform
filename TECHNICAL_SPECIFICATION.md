    this.aiAssistant = new AIWorkflowAssistant();
  }

  async execute() {
    try {
      return await this.temporal.executeWorkflow(this.definition);
    } catch (error) {
      return await this.aiAssistant.handleError(error, this.state);
    }
  }

  async optimizePerformance() {
    const suggestions = await this.aiAssistant.analyzeWorkflow(this.definition);
    return suggestions.apply();
  }
}
```

#### Real-Time Collaboration
```typescript
interface CollaborativeWorkflow {
  participants: User[];
  changes: WorkflowChange[];
  conflictResolution: CRDTResolver;
  
  applyChange(change: WorkflowChange): void;
  broadcastChange(change: WorkflowChange): void;
  resolveConflict(conflict: Conflict): Resolution;
}
```

#### AI Integration Points
```python
class AIWorkflowEngine:
    def __init__(self):
        self.nlp_processor = OpenAIProcessor()
        self.optimization_engine = OptimizationML()
        self.error_recovery = SelfHealingAI()
    
    def process_natural_language(self, input: str) -> Workflow:
        return self.nlp_processor.convert_to_workflow(input)
    
    def optimize_workflow(self, workflow: Workflow) -> OptimizationSuggestions:
        return self.optimization_engine.analyze(workflow)
    
    def handle_errors(self, error: WorkflowError) -> RecoveryAction:
